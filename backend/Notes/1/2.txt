## Definition
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem.

## Characteristics
1. **Input**: Takes zero or more inputs.
2. **Output**: Produces at least one output.
3. **Definiteness**: Each step is clearly defined.
4. **Finiteness**: Must terminate after a finite number of steps.
5. **Effectiveness**: Each step is basic enough to be carried out.

## Types of Algorithms
1. **Divide and Conquer**: Breaks a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves them, and combines their results.
    - Example: Merge Sort, Quick Sort
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Solves problems by breaking them into overlapping sub-problems and storing results.
    - Example: Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem
3. **Greedy Algorithms**: Makes the locally optimal choice at each step.
    - Example: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm
4. **Backtracking**: Explores all possibilities by building a solution incrementally.
    - Example: N-Queens Problem, Sudoku Solver
5. **Brute Force**: Tries all possible solutions to find the correct one.
    - Example: String Matching, Traveling Salesman Problem

## Common Algorithmic Concepts
- **Recursion**: A function calling itself to solve smaller instances of a problem.
- **Iteration**: Repeating a set of instructions until a condition is met.
- **Sorting**: Arranging data in a specific order (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort).
- **Searching**: Finding an element in a data structure (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search).

## Applications

- Artificial intelligence
- Cryptography
- Network routing
- Optimization problems

## Best Practices
- Understand the problem thoroughly.
- Choose the right algorithm for the task.
- Optimize for time and space complexity.
- Test with edge cases.
