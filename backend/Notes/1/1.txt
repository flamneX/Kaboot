## What are Data Structures?
Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

## Types of Data Structures
1. **Linear Data Structures**:
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks
    - Queues

2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**:
    - Trees
    - Graphs

3. **Hash-based Data Structures**:
    - Hash Tables
    - Hash Maps
    - Sets

## Common Operations
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Searching
- Sorting

## Applications
- Arrays: Used in dynamic programming and matrix operations.
- Linked Lists: Used in memory management and undo functionality in editors.
- Stacks: Used in expression evaluation and backtracking algorithms.
- Queues: Used in scheduling and buffering.
- Trees: Used in databases and file systems.
- Graphs: Used in social networks and routing algorithms.
- Hash Tables: Used in caching and indexing.

## Choosing the Right Data Structure
- Consider the type of operations required.
- Analyze time and space complexity.
- Understand the nature of the data.
